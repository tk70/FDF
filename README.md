# Factional Delay, Allpass IIR Filter Design tool for Octave (Matlab)
It is sometimes desired to delay to the signal, less than a sample size long. This tool computes Biquadatic (and other) IIR coefficients.
Generalized formula for any-order IIR and optimized formula for Biquad filter are implemented.

The implementation is based on the following paper:
